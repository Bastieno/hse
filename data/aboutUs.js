      The first in the series of the above International HSE Conference on the
      petroleum industry and the Nigerian environment was organized in 1979. The
      Conference is hosted in different cities of the country. Over the years,
      the Conference has been attracting an ever-increasing and diverse audience
      due to the interdisciplinary nature of HSE.

      of the Federal Government of Nigeria. Thus far, 18 Conferences in the

        The conference serves to engender HSE awareness amongst stakeholders in the
        industry and remains the only forum that brings together HSE experts from
        both within and outside the country to share new ideas and experiences. It
        also provides a valuable opportunity for updates for all professionals
        involved in HSE activities in Exploration and Production and other
        activities in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Furthermore, participants benefit
        from an associated exhibition on HSE related products and services
        including the most up-to-date information and technology on HSE issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the objective of the conference essentially remains the same, it
        evolves to ensure that our industry keeps pace with contemporary HSE issues
        and technological advancement from which the industry’s guidelines and
        standards were derived for the purpose of sustainable development.
